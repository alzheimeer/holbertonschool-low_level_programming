C - more pointers, arrays and strings
This repository contains more projects introducing the use, purpose, and differences between pointers, arrays and strings. Below is a list of the projects following a description for each of them.

File Description
0-strcat.c	A function that concatenates two strings, similar to the standard library function strcat. This function appends the src string to the dest string, overwriting the terminating null byte (\0) at the end of dest, and then adds a terminating null byte. Returns a pointer to the resulting string dest
1-strncat.c	A function that concatenates two strings, similar to the standard library function strncat. The function appends src string ot the dest string, however it will use at most n bytes from src. If src does not need to be null-terminated if it contains n or more bytes.
2-strncpy.c	A function that copies a string. This function works exactly like the standard library function: strncpy.
3-strcmp.c	a function that compares two strings. This function works exactly like the standard library function strncpy. The function will return 0 if the strings are the same and the ascii value difference otherwise.
4-rev_array.c	A function that reverses the content of an array of integers. n is the number of elements of the array to reverse.
5-string_toupper.c	   A function that changes all lowercase letters of a string to uppercase.
6-cap_string.c		   A function that capitalizes all words of a string. Work seperators include: space, tabulation, new line, ,, ;, ., !, ?, ", (, ), {, and }.
7-leet.c		   A function that encodes a string to 1337.
8-rot13.c		   A function that encodes a string using rot13.
100-print_number.c	   A function that prints an integer. No standard library functions are allowed.
101-magic.c		   A program that changes value of a pointer by moving through the memory stack and prints the new value.
102-infinite_add.c	   A function that adds two numbers. An array will hold the result and the function will return a pointer to the array. Assumptions: the numbers given will always be positive or 0, there will only be digits.
103-print_buffer.c	   A function that prints a buffer.
